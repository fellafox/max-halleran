## Milestone 1 Feedback
Excellent work here Emily - Your purpose, audience, goal, persona and use case are all thoughtfully crafted and very well outlined. This will provide you with an excellent guide regarding your UI design and content strategy choices in the milestones to follow. Your HTML is also excellent - really nice work here.

I took note when I read the words "tactful simplicity" - I love it already. Sophisticated presentation of relevant information can make or break a site, and I'm looking forward to seeing what design and content ideas you come up with. If it helps, consider bookmarking examples of sites that are attractive and inspire you. This can help your wireframing, UI and content design process.

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/capstone/rubric/). You're clear to begin work on [Milestone 2&alpha;](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/). Go ahead and read the documentation on bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu if you like, and I will be going over [Milestone 2&alpha;](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/) in class on Monday 5/1 as well.
