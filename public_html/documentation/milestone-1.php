		<h2>Use Case</h2>
		<p>Stewart has come across Max's portfolio at about 10AM in the morning while he is sitting at his desk at work. He has just finished his first cup of coffee and it has somehow already started to wear off. He is tired of sifting through inefficiently designed online portfolios and slapped together resumes. He is looking for someone young yet skilled who is able to show you everything you need to know without over-saturating. He is using his relatively new Macbook Pro to access the site and already likes the "smart look" that Max's portfolio gives off. It is refreshing to come across in today's advertisement filled internet.</p>
